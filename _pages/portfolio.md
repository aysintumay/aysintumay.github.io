**Welcome!**

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). My current research revolves around automizing mechanical circulatory devices for treatment recommendation tasks using time series forecasting.

I graduated from Bilkent University with a B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I was a Machine Learning Researcher in [Prof. S. Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/)'s research group. 

During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on **time series forecasting**, **data science**, and **signal processing**. Specifically, my work involved designing cutting-edge algorithms for time series and spatiotemporal prediction in high-dimensional spaces. [Here](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.17544
) is a preprint that I first-authored on this topic. 

The latest version of my CV can be found [here](/files/aysintumay_cv.pdf).
