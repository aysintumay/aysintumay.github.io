**Welcome!**

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego. I am lucky enough to be advised by Prof. [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). 

I graduated from Bilkent University with a B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I was a Machine Learning Researcher in [Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/)'s research group. 

During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on **time series forecasting**, **data science**, and **signal processing**. Specifically, my work involved designing cutting-edge algorithms for time series and spatiotemporal prediction, in high-dimensional spaces. [Here] is a preprint that I first-authored on this topic. 

The latest version of my CV can be found [here](/files/aysintumay_cv.pdf).
